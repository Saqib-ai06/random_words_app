## Why I made this project?

I made this project to learn flutter development. 

I choose Flutter over react cuz react uses different languages for front-end and back-end, whereas flutter only uses one language (dart) and also I didn't wanted to learn multiple languages although I know the basics of programming languages and I can adapt to new languages I start to learn but this time I did not had much time to learn the basics of multiple languages then dive into development.

That's it.
